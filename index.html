               <p class="text">
                  Modern kitchen design consists of sleek, angular, and simple designs featuring little hardware, flush
                  doors, and flat surfaces. They are usually of geometric forms and they contain little or no
                  ornamentation or adornments. The kitchen designs, modern or traditional, have some distinctive
                  features themselves. Notice how the gold accents of the vintage cabinet-pulls ties in with the
                  contemporary pendant lights above this dining table. The decor unites the two spaces together.

                  Nothing says bright and well-lit like this beautiful room. The living space comprises a couch and
                  chairs in soft grey shades, counterbalanced by the table and shelves in warm brown. The room is
                  adjacent to a white minimalist kitchen with modern black stools and spot light fixtures in the
                  ceiling.

               <p class="text">
                  While an open kitchen and dining area affords you great ease of movement, it often works to zone them
                  to create two distinct spaces. Here are some easy design techniques to help you ace your zoning game.
                  We love the ‘wall’ divider set up between the kitchen and dining room here. It works brilliantly to
                  psychologically break the two areas up.

               <p class="text">
                  One of the most popular locations for a TV in the bedroom is on the wall. The TV becomes a big black
                  box decor and at the same time saves you space in your bedroom, Mounting the TV on your wall is an
                  easy task but if you are not confident to do the job then you might as well hire somehow to do it for
                  you ,The key to mounting your TV is knowing the best location to install it. You may find it more
                  comfortable if the TV is directly parallel to your bed or you want it a bit on the side.

                  <p> What makes these modern house designs so special and different from others? Well, one of the
                     criteria was location of the house, which often plays important role in the way house is designed.

                  <p> A house plan is a drawing that illustrates the layout of a home. House plans are useful because
                     they give you an idea of the flow of the home and how each room connects with each other.</p>

                  <p> In case you opt for a village house in a hilly area, it is ideal to keep the structure light to
                     counter the possibility of earthquakes, floods and landslides. This house in the village is a
                     perfect example of a small cottage in a hilly area.</p>

                  <h3> House size</h3>
                  <p>Next, size of the house. Common opinion among people is that house has to be huge or expensive to
                     be beautiful or amazing. This is really, really far from being true. You will notice I picked some
                     pretty small houses (in comparison to others) for this list. For example, this minimalist house and
                     this creative home. Good architects and their clients who have taste and style will together create
                     gorgeous modern house designs, no matter how big the house is at the end.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="box">
                  <h3>Architectural style</h3>
                  <p> Speaking of style, this brings us to the next criteria. Style in architecture. This is another
                     thing strongly related to someone’s personality, but you have to admit, when someone has style,
                     this is obvious to everyone. I think architects and owners of those homes have amazing style in
                     architecture and this is one of the reasons why I put those homes on the list.</p>

               <div class="box">
                  <h3>Modern front facade design</h3>
                  <p> Front facade is probably the most important part of every house design. Since it is facing public
                     area, it is essential to make sure that the house blends well with the surrounding and fits in the
                     neighborhood in general. These two houses, designed by Antoni Associates (you can read more about
                     this modern mansion here) and Martin Friedrich Architects, are great examples of elegance and
                     overall sophistication of modern house design, especially when it comes to front facade.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="box">
                  <h3>Exterior house design facing the backyard</h3>
                  <p> Even though front facade is of somewhat greater importance when it comes to a house design, the
                     backyard facade is far from being unimportant. Next two modern houses are perfect examples of
                     exterior house design facing the backyard where modern house design is complemented with terraces,
                     swimming pools and gardens. </p>
